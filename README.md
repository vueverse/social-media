# Social-Media: A Full-Featured Social Media Application Inspired by Instagram üåü
Social-Media is a comprehensive social media application designed to replicate and extend the core functionality of Instagram, providing a modern, scalable, and high-performance platform for social interaction. The application includes features such as user profiles, posts, stories, messaging, notifications, and more. Built with a microservices architecture, it leverages cutting-edge technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, reactive programming, and event-driven design patterns.

# Key Features üöÄ
**User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using JWT-based authentication, with support for social login (OAuth).
**Profile Management:** Create, update, and manage user profiles, including profile pictures, bios, and privacy settings.
**Posts and Stories:** Share photos, videos, and text posts with captions, tags, and locations. Create and view stories that disappear after 24 hours.
**Direct Messaging:** Real-time one-to-one and group messaging using WebSockets for seamless communication.
**Content Engagement:** Like, comment, share posts, and interact with stories using polls, questions, and quizzes.
**Follow System:** Follow or unfollow users, view followers and following lists, and receive notifications for new follows.
**Notifications:** Receive real-time notifications for likes, comments, follows, and messages.
**Content Moderation:** Report inappropriate content and manage blocked users.
**Analytics:** Gain insights into engagement metrics, such as reach, likes, and follower demographics.
**High Performance:** Optimized for speed and scalability with reactive programming and event-driven architecture.
## Architecture and Technologies üèóÔ∏è
The backend is built using Java, Kotlin (Spring Boot), and Go, with a focus on microservices architecture. Each microservice is designed to be domain-centric and follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

# Backend Stack:
**Languages:** Java, Kotlin, Go
**Framework:** Spring Boot (Java, Kotlin), Gorilla (Go)
**Microservices:** Designed with a domain-centric architecture, each service operates independently with its own domain logic and data storage.
**Reactive Programming:** Built using reactive programming principles to handle high loads and provide a responsive user experience.
**Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilizes event-driven design to handle asynchronous communication and maintain system consistency across microservices.
**Data Storage:** Supports both SQL and NoSQL databases to meet various data needs.
**Caching:** Implements caching with Redis for fast access to frequently requested data.
**Containerization:** Dockerized microservices for consistent development and deployment environments.
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes for automatic scaling, management, and deployment of microservices.
# Security üîí
The application is designed with a security-first approach to protect user data and ensure safe interactions:

**JWT Authentication:** Secure user authentication using JWT tokens to manage sessions and API access.
**OAuth2:** Support for third-party authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook) to enhance user onboarding experience.
**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces different access levels for users, admins, and moderators.
**Data Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest using strong encryption standards.
**Keycloak Integration:** Implements Keycloak for centralized authentication, authorization, and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.
**API Security:** Protects APIs from common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
**Regular Security Audits:** Automated security testing and regular audits to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated.
# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) üìö
The application follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to model complex domains effectively:

**Event Storming:** A collaborative workshop technique used to explore and understand complex business processes. It helps in identifying key events, commands, and aggregates within the domain.

Example: For a messaging service, event storming might identify events like MessageSent, MessageReceived, and MessageRead. It maps out how these events interact with aggregates like Conversation and User.
Bounded Contexts: Define clear boundaries within the application where a particular model applies. Each bounded context can have its own domain model, ensuring clarity and reducing complexity.

Example: In the social media app, the User Management bounded context handles user profiles and authentication, while the Content Management context deals with posts and stories.
Aggregates and Entities: Design aggregates that encapsulate business logic and enforce consistency boundaries. Entities within aggregates represent core business objects.

Example: The Conversation aggregate might include entities like Message and Participant.
Repositories and Services: Repositories handle data access and persistence, while domain services contain domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or aggregate.

Example: A MessageRepository manages message storage, and a NotificationService handles sending notifications.
# DevOps and CI/CD ‚öôÔ∏è
**Docker:** Containerized microservices for consistent development and deployment environments.
**Kubernetes:** Orchestrates microservices for scalability, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
**CI/CD:** Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines.
# Testing and Quality Assurance üß™
**Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ensures all features are thoroughly tested using unit and integration tests.
**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Utilizes tools like Cucumber for behavior-driven testing, aligning tests with business requirements.
**Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Follows DDD principles to model complex domains and maintain a clear separation of concerns.
